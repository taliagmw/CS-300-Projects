For this course the goal was to create working code that could compile a list from data in a CSV file and sort into a printed list. I apprached this by taking into consideration what was needed and going from there to work with the data structures. I did a lot of revising of code and working in Zybooks to try and get my code to function properly. Working on this project has expanded my approach by encouraging me to utilize vectors, hashtables, and binary search trees. My work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by pushing me to go back and revise the code several times and keep datasets in mind while working on the code.
